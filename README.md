### Project Overview

This project is an in-depth data analysis of global COVID-19 trends. The goal was to process, analyze, and visualize data related to cases, deaths, and vaccinations across selected countries. The final report is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, combining code, visualizations, and a narrative summary of key findings.

### üéØ Project Objectives

- **Data Processing:** Import and clean a real-world COVID-19 dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze time-series trends and compare key metrics across countries.
- **Data Visualization:** Create insightful charts and a choropleth map to illustrate the metrics.
- **Insight Communication:** Present findings in a clear and well-structured report.

### üß† Conclusions and Insights

#### Overview of Cases and Deaths

The initial analysis of cumulative case and death data reveals that the United States and India had the highest absolute totals among the countries studied. This outcome is not surprising given their large populations, which make them key reference points for understanding the scale of the pandemic.

#### Mortality Rate: An Indicator of Severity

Although Brazil's total case and death counts do not surpass those of the U.S. and India, the analysis of the **mortality rate** (total deaths / total cases) offers a different perspective. With a rate of **6.99%**, Brazil showed the highest proportion of deaths relative to confirmed cases. This figure is crucial for understanding the severity of the pandemic‚Äôs impact, demonstrating that the seriousness of the disease in a country can be high regardless of the total case volume.

#### Linking Vaccination to Case Trends

The vaccination analysis highlights differing adoption and distribution trends across countries. India showed a sharply accelerating vaccination curve. In contrast, the vaccination in South Africa appeared to experience a slowdown, and the data from Brazil and the United States indicates that mass vaccination reached a plateau by 2023. A visual correlation can be observed between increased vaccination and the stabilization or decline in case and death curves in some countries, suggesting a positive impact from vaccination campaigns.
